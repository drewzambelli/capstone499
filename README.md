Repo for final compsci major project
Ideas for Capstone Project:

1) IDEA 1: Citibikes: Pull citi-bike data from CitiBank's website to write a website that allows visitors to visualize Citibike travel for any given
day of the year. The website would be a map of citibike stations that allows the user to see all data associated with the station and the bikes associated
with that station, including: usage, travel times, travel paths and any associated rider information (rider information is anonymized, however, prior to 2022
the Citi bike program did publish the rider's gender and year-of-birth).

2) IDEA 2: Livery Service Vehicles: Using NYC Open Data, create a website that allows a user to enter a livery service vehicle license plate to see a variety of
data points about the vehicle and the driver associated with the vehicle (as of close of business each day when data is updated). Then use the driver's name to
scrape the web for any information that may be associated with the driver.

3) IDEA 3: Payroll. Using NYC Open Data, create a website that allows users to see the salary of public NYC employees and their *overtime* pay (it is amazing how
many public employees are earning almost doubling their base salary as overtime). Then using the employee's name, scrape the web for any associated social media
information that can be tied to them.

4) IDEA 4: Neighborhoods. Build a website which allows users to pull up maps of different neighborhoods/localities within NYC to see points and people of interest
and other data of significance (crime, traffic, economic data, good restaurants, etc.). Maybe also to tie in IDEA 3: Payroll, attempt to link the address of NYC
employees to specific neighborhoods, specifically those who seem to be abusing overtime policies.

TECHNOLOGIES:
All three of these ideas would use similar, if not the same, resources and front/backend tech:

1) IDE: VisualStudio Code
2) DATA: NYC Open Data excels / or some other source of excels
3) FRONTEND: HTML, CSS, GOOGLE MAPS API, CHART.JS, REACT.JS
4) BACKEND: NODE.JS 
5) DATABASE/DATA MANIPULATION/SCRAPING: SQL, MONGODB, PANDAS, BEAUTIFUL SOUP

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
Depending on the project, I might be linking someone's virtual profile to their salary and or physical travel paths which obviously carry ethical considerations
and possibly legal ones too. Also, with any data scraping, one needs to be aware of online policies for the specific sites scraped.
